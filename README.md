# README
A simple app that simulates what a student may see as they are searching for courses for a school. Students can create a course so that it gets stored to the database, then viewed on the main page. Students also have the ability to enter a filter which will only show the courses with a specified quarter offered.
TODO:
-implement update and destroy options for the courses
-view the coures as a table vs a long list
-Modify courses to include the students enrolled.
